**Technical Builder & Operator**  
AI-assisted development • Backend systems • Product mindset

I build real software systems in real-world constraints.  
Focused on shipping working products, not collecting credentials.

## About
I am a systems-oriented builder who designs and ships end-to-end software products using modern tooling and AI-assisted workflows.

My work is shaped by real operational constraints: limited time, real users, and systems that must run reliably without constant supervision.  
I care about structure, clarity, and practical outcomes more than hype or titles.

---

## What I work on
- **Backend systems & automation**  
  Python, async workflows, APIs, background jobs, real-time data processing

- **AI integration (practical use)**  
  LLMs used as force multipliers for analysis, decision support, and automation — not demos

- **Product interfaces when needed**  
  Mobile and UI layers built to support real systems (React Native / Expo)
